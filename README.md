# The Forgotten Wastes

The year is 2077. Decades ago, a nuclear bomb devastated your hometown. You were just a young boy.  
Fortunately, Vault-Tec had completed construction of a nearby vault just months before the blast.

Years passed. Supplies dwindled. To survive, the vaultâ€™s overseer began sending residents to the surface every month to scavenge for food and resources. Many never returned.

This month, it's your turn.

Venture into the wastes, face down mutants, and scavenge whatever you can to keep the vault alive. How long can you last?
